## Tasks realized 

1) Data cleaning;
2) Elimination of missing values;
3) New feature generation;
4) Feature transformation;
5) Feature selection
6) Teaching a model of RandomForestRegressor, implemented in the sklearn library.
7) Assessing the quality of the model using the MAPE metric (mean absolute percentage error).
## Summary

   *At the final step 74 features was selected for model teaching.
   *The score reached in [the Booking reviews competition](https://www.kaggle.com/code/siarheis/hotel-sc-prediction?scriptVersionId=140108874 "Link to the competition page on Kaggle"): 11.88.
