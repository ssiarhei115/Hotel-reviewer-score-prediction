# Hotel reviewer score prediction

## Main goal
Creating a model that should predict the rating of a hotel according to the Booking website based on the data available in the dataset. The dataset contains information about 515,000 hotel reviews in Europe. 

## Tasks realized 

1) Data cleaning;
2) Elimination of missing values;
3) New feature generation;
4) Feature transformation;
5) Feature selection
6) Teaching a model of RandomForestRegressor, implemented in the sklearn library.
7) Assessing the quality of the model using the MAPE metric (mean absolute percentage error).
## Summary

    *At the final step 74 features was selected for model teaching.
    *The score reached: 11.88. That correspond 18th place in the competition
